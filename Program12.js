/*12th Program: Greetings:
Start with the array you used in Exercise 11,
but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, 
but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.*/

var names=["Ali","Laraib","Zain","Hassan"];
 console.log(names[0]+" you are invited for the  dinner at my house at 7 pm");
 console.log(names[1]+" you are invited for the  dinner at my house at 7 pm");
 console.log(names[2]+" you are invited for the  dinner at my house at 7 pm");
 console.log(names[3]+" you are invited for the  dinner at my house at 7 pm");
